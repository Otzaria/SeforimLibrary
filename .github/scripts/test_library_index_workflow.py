"""Contract tests for build-library-index.yml.

The library search index used to be rebuilt inside every Otzaria/otzaria
release build — 118 minutes of the 130-minute `Linux full x86_64` job of run
34779834547, with two further jobs waiting on it — although it is a pure
function of seforim.db and of the search engine. It is now built once per
database release, here, and stored on that release.

Two properties are load-bearing and invisible in a green run, so they are
pinned here:

  * this must never sit on the database release's critical path, and must never
    start on one of the per-build releases the pipeline publishes while the
    database build is still running;
  * the stored index must stay platform-neutral, which holds only while the
    bundled PDFs are kept out of it (a PDF's index key is its own absolute
    path, so indexing one on a runner would bake a runner path into an archive
    that Windows, macOS and Android clients consume).

Assertions read the parsed workflow, not its comment text.
