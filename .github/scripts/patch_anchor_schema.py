"""Pre-download patchability verdict for one patch-fan anchor.

The release patch fan reconstitutes every anchor's DB from that release's
1.3 GB ``seforim.db.zst`` (110-135 s download plus ~7 s decompress) before
``PatchDbProducer`` ever gets to say the pair cannot be expressed as a delta at
all: run 33865604251 spent ~140 s on the v10 anchor only to be handed
``UnpatchableAnchorException``.  This module answers the same question from a
few KB of metadata.

It is strictly advisory, and asymmetric on purpose:

* ``PROCEED`` is not a patchability claim.  It means "not provably unpatchable
  from metadata"; the producer keeps being the single authority and still says
  so with exit code 3 plus the ``<out>.unpatchable`` marker.
* ``UNPATCHABLE`` costs the fan at most one anchor, which the workflow already
  treats as a warning.  A release that loses *every* anchor still fails loudly
  in the fan's final check.

Two sources, cheapest first:

1. :data:`LEGACY_UNPATCHABLE_DB_VERSIONS` - releases published before this
   metadata existed that the repository's own history proves carry a dropped
   column.
2. The anchor release's ``build_provenance.json`` ``db_schema`` block (written
   by ``dump`` below, from db_version 27 on -- v26 was published 2026-09-04
   with ``schema_version`` 3 and no such block): the exact physical column set
   of the DB that release published.  Applying the producer's own first rule to it
   - a column that exists in prev's table and no longer exists in new's - is
   exact, not heuristic.

The comparison is scoped exactly like `PatchDbProducer.planColumnMigrations`:
only the tables of the patch contract (`patch_tables_contract.json`, the same
fixture `PatchTablesContractTest` freezes) and, of those, only the ones the
producer would actually column-diff.  A physical table outside the contract, or
one *promoted* into the contract by the schema bump, is skipped there and must
be skipped here too - otherwise a dropped column in such a table would cost the
fan a patch the producer would have produced.  Whenever that scope cannot be
established, the verdict is PROCEED; it never widens to "every physical table".

``dump`` is deliberately the *only* producer of that block, so what a build
publishes about itself and what a later build compares against are the same
bytes by construction.

# Anchors that predate the `db_schema` provenance block and are known - not

#
#   * commit 7755902 (2026-07-14) replaced `link.isDeclaredBase` with
#     `link.baseProvenance` without bumping `db_schema_version`, so DBs
#     released before it still claim schema 1 while carrying a column the
#     current schema no longer declares - exactly the shape
#     `PatchDbProducer.planColumnMigrations` calls unpatchable;
#   * commit 849f754 ("feat(patch): add missing columns and indexes by
#     migration instead of skipping the anchor") records the measured range:
#     "Verified on real data: v9 (with its dropped link.isDeclaredBase removed)
#     to v25 produced 15 migrations and passed the apply-hash check. v9 to v13
#     remain skipped until the dropped column is handled.";
#   * run 33865604251 (building v26) re-confirmed it for the v10 anchor.
#
# The lower bound is reachability, not the start of the damage: v1-v8 predate
# 7755902 too (v8 was published 2026-07-06, v13 2026-07-09, v14 2026-07-19 --
# the first release built after the swap), but no offset in {1,2,4,8,16} can
# reach below v11 from db_version 27 on, so listing them would be dead code.
# Deliberately a closed set, not an open-ended "everything below N": v14-v25
# are known-good (v25 was produced from the same evidence) and must keep being
# offered to the producer.  The whole list can be deleted once db_version 30
# ships, when offset 16 no longer reaches v13.
